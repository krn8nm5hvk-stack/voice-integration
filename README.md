# Telegram + Twilio Voice Integration

## Overview
This project is developed by **Marc Cine**, an independent developer.  
It integrates **Twilio Voice** with **Telegram** to enable real-time voice call updates, user prompts, and captured inputs directly inside Telegram chats.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to make communication workflows smoother and more responsive.  
The application:
- Sends real-time call notifications to a Telegram bot  
- Captures keypad inputs (DTMF tones) from callers  
- Logs call details and user responses for follow-up or automation  
- Enables developers or businesses to interact with callers via Telegram in real time  

Example use case:
> When a customer calls a business number, the system can forward call details to a Telegram chat, allowing the business owner to view and respond in real time.

## Technologies
- **Python / Flask** for backend logic  
- **Twilio Voice API** for call management and event handling  
- **Telegram Bot API** for user notifications and chat integration  
- **Webhook** and **Twilio Studio Flow** for call routing
